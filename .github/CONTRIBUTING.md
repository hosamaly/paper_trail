## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please email jared@jaredbeck.com and batkinz@gmail.com. Do not mention the
vulnerability publicly until there's a fix.

We will respond as soon as we can. Thank you for responsibly disclosing
security vulnerabilities.

## Usage Questions

Due to limited volunteers, we cannot answer *usage* questions. Please ask such
questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/paper-trail-gem).

## Reporting Bugs

You want to fix a bug, but need some help.

> You are required to provide a script that reproduces the bug, using our

Due to limited volunteers, we cannot fix everyone's bugs for them. We're happy
to help, but we can only accept issues from people committed to working on their
own problems.

Different people use different parts of PaperTrail. You may have found a bug,
but you might also be the only person affected by that bug. Don't hesitate to
ask for whatever help you need, but it's your job to fix it.

## Development

Install gems with `bundle exec appraisal install`.

Testing is a little awkward because the test suite:

1. Supports multiple versions of rails
1. Contains a "dummy" rails app with three databases (test, foo, and bar)
1. Supports three different RDBMS': sqlite, mysql, and postgres

### Test sqlite, AR 4

```
DB=sqlite bundle exec appraisal ar-4.2 rake

# Run a single test
DB=sqlite bundle exec appraisal ar-4.2 rspec spec/paper_trail_spec.rb
```

### Test sqlite, AR 5

```
DB=sqlite bundle exec appraisal ar-5.2 rake
```

### Test mysql, AR 5

```
DB=mysql bundle exec appraisal ar-5.2 rake
```

### Test postgres, AR 5

```
createuser --superuser postgres
DB=postgres bundle exec appraisal ar-5.2 rake
```

## Adding new schema

Edit `spec/dummy_app/db/migrate/20110208155312_set_up_test_tables.rb`. Migration
will be performed by `rake`, so you can just run it as shown above. Also,
`spec/dummy_app/db/schema.rb` is deliberately `.gitignore`d, we don't use it.
