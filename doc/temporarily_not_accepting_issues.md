# Temporarily Not Accepting Issues

March, 2019

Pull requests are still welcome.

We've had trouble recently with people refusing to follow the [Issue
Templates](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

Issues are temporarily disabled while we discuss, as a team, how to handle
this problem.

Unfortunately, GitHub does not seem to offer a way of disabling the *creation*
of new issues without also hiding existing issues.

You can go to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/paper-trail-gem) and/or [use google cache to view some issues](https://www.google.com/?q=papertrail+gem+issues+site%3Agithub.com).
